// The 7 Primitive Data Types 

// Primitive data type is basically a basic type of data type that reprsents the most common. The main three are strings, booleans, and numbers.

// These have very special use cases. bigint - a special type of number in JS and symbol - a special immutable data type]
// These will not be used in javascript basics, well in this repo.

//JS is also unique that it It is sometimes useful for programming languages to represent the lack of a value. 
// So, JS makes use of two other data types, undefined and null.

"This is a string, it also uses quotation marks like python, single or double"


***Escaping Characters*** 
// We may sometimes need to use a string that uses both single and double quotation marks.
// So, we would use escaping characters for this.  
// We use the backslash \ character to tell JS the that following character should not be used to end the string.

e.g. 'Let\'s escape the single quote!'

Test: Create the following string:
    '"Hello World!" said the developer's robot.'

Answer: 
    '\"Hello World!\" said the developer\'s robot.'


***Booleans***
true or false without quotation marks

***Numbers***
Integers - whole numbers e.g. 46

Floating point - decimal values that use full stops. e.g. 3.46

Sometimes, we might find ourselves trying to express a value 
that isn't a number as a numberâ€”for example, when we try to
multiply two strings together. JavaScript provides a 
special value for these situations called "Not a Number", 
or NaN.
